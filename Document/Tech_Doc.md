# AI Skiing Coach - Technical Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction
Skiing requires precise body control and balance. Many amateur skiers struggle to improve due to the lack of accessible and affordable coaching. The AI Skiing Coach aims to bridge this gap by leveraging **Computer Vision, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to analyze skiing techniques from user-uploaded videos and provide actionable feedback.

## 2. System Overview
The AI Skiing Coach consists of four core components:
1. **Pose Estimation & Motion Tracking** - Extracts key body joint positions and tracks motion over time.
2. **Data Annotation & Model Training** - Labels skiing postures and errors for supervised learning.
3. **Performance Analysis** - Classifies skiing techniques and identifies common mistakes.
4. **AI-Powered Feedback Generation** - Uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** with an **LLM** to provide personalized improvement suggestions.

```
User → Video Upload → Preprocessing → Pose Estimation → Feature Extraction → Performance Analysis → LLM Feedback Generation → Output Feedback
```
### 3.2 Detailed Component Breakdown

#### **3.2.1 Pose Estimation & Motion Tracking**
- **Technology:** OpenPose, MediaPipe, BlazePose
- **Process:**
  - Extract key points (shoulders, knees, ankles, etc.)
  - Track movement over time
  - Calculate joint angles and body positioning
- **Output:** A time-series dataset of key joint positions

#### **3.2.2 Data Annotation & Model Training**
- **Annotation:**
  - Manual labeling by ski instructors
  - Rule-based automated labeling for common mistakes (e.g., knee angle < 90° → "insufficient knee bend")
  - Semi-supervised learning for scalable data labeling
- **Training Pipeline:**
  - **Input:** Pose estimation time-series data with labeled movement patterns
  - **Model Type:** CNN + LSTM / Transformer
  - **Output:** A classifier that identifies errors such as "leaning backward" or "knees too straight"

#### **3.2.3 Performance Analysis**
- **Process:**
  - Compare extracted movement features with professional skiing datasets
  - Identify deviations and classify common technique flaws
- **Approaches:**
  - **Rule-based system (MVP)**: Threshold-based evaluation
  - **Deep learning model**: Multi-label classification of skiing techniques

#### **3.2.4 AI-Powered Feedback Generation**
- **Technology:** Local Large Language Model (LLM) + RAG
- **Steps:**
  1. Store skiing techniques and expert guidelines in a knowledge base
  2. Use **LLM fine-tuned on skiing knowledge** to generate feedback
  3. **RAG Pipeline:**
     - Retrieve expert guidance based on detected skiing errors
     - Generate personalized feedback with natural language responses
- **Output:** Actionable suggestions on how to improve skiing posture and movement
